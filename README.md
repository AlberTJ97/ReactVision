Simple image processing web app built with React for the subject of Computer Vision at the Computer engineering degree ([La Laguna University](https://www.ull.es)).

## Check out the web!
The web is deployed and tested on Chrome and Safari. It is not responsive (sorry for that :disappointed:).

You can test the webpage here:

* Linear point operations
  * Gray scale convertion (black and white)
  * Linear picewise adjustment
  * Brightness and contrast adjustment
* Non - linear point operations
  * Histogram equalization
  * Histogram specification
  * Gamma correction
  * Image difference
  * Changes detection
  * Cross image section
  * Quantization
* Geometric operations
  * Image flipper
  * Traspose image
  * Scale image
